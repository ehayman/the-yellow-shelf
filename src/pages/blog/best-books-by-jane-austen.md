  Austen's novels are widely considered well ahead of their time - each one a
  perfect stew of biting wit, social commentary, and humor - all topped with a
  bay leaf of irony.

      Adopted into the household of her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, Fanny Price
      grows up a meek outsider among her cousins in the unaccustomed elegance of
      Mansfield Park. Soon after Sir Thomas absents himself on estate business
      in Antigua (the family's investment in slavery and sugar is considered in
      the Introduction in a new, post-colonial light), Mary Crawford and her
      brother Henry arrive at Mansfield, bringing with them London glamour, and
      the seductive taste for flirtation and theatre that precipitates a crisis.
      While *Mansfield Park* appears in some ways to continue where *Pride and
      Prejudice* left off, it is, as Kathryn Sutherland shows in her
      illuminating Introduction, a much darker work, which challenges 'the very
      values (of tradition, stability, retirement and faithfulness) it appears
      to endorse'. This new edition provides an accurate text based, for the
      first time since its original publication, on the first edition of 1814.

      Jane Austen's first novel—published posthumously in 1818—tells the story
      of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and
      sometime self-delusion. Though Austen's fallible heroine is repeatedly
      drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent
      visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into
      a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power
      of literature. The satirical novel pokes fun at the gothic novel while
      earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.

      Emma Woodhouse is one of Austen's most captivating and vivid characters.
      Beautiful, spoilt, vain and irrepressibly witty, Emma organizes the lives
      of the inhabitants of her sleepy little village and plays matchmaker with
      devastating effect.

      Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in
      love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her
      sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to
      gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social
      convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even
      from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love—and
      its threatened loss—the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility
      if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money
      govern the rules of love.

      Since its immediate success in 1813,*Pride and Prejudice*has remained one
      of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called
      this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine,
      Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."
      The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau,
      Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane
      Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille
      of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of
      manners of Regency England.

      There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think
      well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and
      every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters,
      and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit
      or sense.

      Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight
      years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval
      officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the
      engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is
      unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret.
      When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he
      finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a
      tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel
      revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their
      love?
