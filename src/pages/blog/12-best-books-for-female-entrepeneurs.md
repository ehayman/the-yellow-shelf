      Sally Jay's voice is sharp and poignant in the same breath; meanwhile, the
      story is less of an arc and more of a frolic. Young and rootless and in
      Paris for the first time, she flits around the city reveling in everything
      (and everyone) with which she comes in contact. In the words of Groucho
      Marx, "it made me laugh, scream, and guffaw (which, incidentally, is a
      great name for a law firm)."


      “I always expect people to behave much better than I do. When they
      actually behave worse, I am frankly incredulous.”

      Julia Child loved two things in this world deeply: France, and the "many
      pleasures of cooking and eating." Beautifully written, this story
      chronicles Julia's discovery of both these passions, from her first
      lunchtime glass of wine (the horror!) to the eventual publication of her
      now-iconic *Mastering the Art of French Cooking.*


      "The longer I was in France, the stronger and more ecstatic my feelings
      for it became. I missed my family, of course, and things like certain
      cosmetics or really good coffee. But the U.S. seemed like an increasingly
      distant and dreamlike place."

      Very few novels have the power to both make me sob my guts out in a
      mascara-running-this-is-not-remotely-attractive type way *and* stay up far
      too late on a school night turning pages as quickly as I can unstick them
      from my tears. *The Great Believers* is massive in the scope it covers,
      but still feels deeply familiar; split between the 1980's Chicago AIDS
      epidemic and modern day Paris, it reckons with the lasting impact on both
      a community and its survivors.


      "And was friendship that different in the end from love? You took the
      possibility of sex out of it, and it was all about the moment anyway.
      Being here, right now, in someone’s life. Making room for someone in
      yours."
