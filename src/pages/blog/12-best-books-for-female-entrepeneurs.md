      Sally Jay's voice is sharp and poignant in the same breath; meanwhile, the
      story is less of an arc and more of a frolic. In the words of Groucho
      Marx, "it made me laugh, scream, and guffaw (which, incidentally, is a
      great name for a law firm)."


      “I always expect people to behave much better than I do. When they
      actually behave worse, I am frankly incredulous.”

      Julia Child loved two things in this world deeply: France, and the "many
      pleasures of cooking and eating." Beautifully written, this story
      chronicles Julia's discovery of both these passions, from her first
      lunchtime glass of wine (the horror!) to the eventual publication of her
      now-iconic *Mastering the Art of French Cooking.*


      "The longer I was in France, the stronger and more ecstatic my feelings
      for it became. I missed my family, of course, and things like certain
      cosmetics or really good coffee. But the U.S. seemed like an increasingly
      distant and dreamlike place."
