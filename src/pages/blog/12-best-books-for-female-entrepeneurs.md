  France is, somewhat surprisingly, the most successful foreign market for
  McDonalds. A rebranding (green logo instead of red) combined with locally
  sourced ingredients (initially for political reasons but with the side effect
  of tastier burgers) has led to "McDo" <a

      Sally Jay's voice is sharp and poignant in the same breath; meanwhile, the
      story is less of an arc and more of a frolic. Young and rootless and in
      Paris for the first time, she flits around the city reveling in everything
      (and everyone) with which she comes in contact. In the words of Groucho
      Marx, "it made me laugh, scream, and guffaw (which, incidentally, is a
      great name for a law firm)."

      they actually behave worse, I am frankly incredulous.”</blockquote>

    bookauthor: 'Julia Child, Alex Prud''Homme'

    description: >-
      Julia Child loved two things in this world deeply: France, and the "many
      pleasures of cooking and eating." Beautifully written, this story
      chronicles Julia's discovery of both these passions, from her first
      lunchtime glass of wine (the horror!) to the eventual publication of her
      now-iconic <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>.


      <blockquote>"The longer I was in France, the stronger and more ecstatic my
      feelings for it became. I missed my family, of course, and things like
      certain cosmetics or really good coffee. But the U.S. seemed like an
      increasingly distant and dreamlike place."</blockquote>

      Very few novels have the power to both make me sob my guts out in a
      mascara-running-this-is-not-remotely-attractive type way *and* stay up far
      too late on a school night turning pages as quickly as I can unstick them
      from my tears. <em>The Great Believers</em> is massive in the scope it
      covers, but still feels deeply familiar; split between the 1980's Chicago
      AIDS epidemic and modern day Paris, it reckons with the lasting impact on
      both a community and its survivors.


      <blockquote>"And was friendship that different in the end from love? You
      took the possibility of sex out of it, and it was all about the moment
      anyway. Being here, right now, in someone’s life. Making room for someone
      in yours."</blockquote>

    bookauthor: George Orwell
    coverimage: /img/9780141184388.jpg
    description: >-
      Orwell's fictional memoir mucks around in the basest of Parisian society
      during the early 20th century. The highlight is perhaps his descriptions
      of the grand hôtel kitchens - the general filth and infestation lying just
      below the glitter and sparkle above - followed by his friendships formed
      with tramps, gutter-dwellers, and general down-and-outs.


      <blockquote>"It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing
      yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going
      to the dogs — and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and
      you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety."</blockquote>

    description: >-
      "Thriller" doesn't quite cover this novel - it's the type of book that
      lodges itself in an uncomfortable part of your brain, in a place where you
      can never quite reach to scratch it away. The story follows the embedding
      of a nanny into the picture-perfect Parisian life of a lawyer's family,
      from the murder of the children to the events preceding. While you never
      do get the perfect answer, the consistent sense of disquiet along the way
      more than makes up for it.

      do without."</blockquote>

    title: The Perfect Nanny
---
I've lived in Paris for three years now. It's a city that for so many is imbued with the stuff of fairytales; cobblestone streets and romance under yellow-lit lanterns. The systemic shock that occurs once one is faced with the gritty reality of a simultaneously aging and modern city grappling with the 21st century - as most cities eventually must do - is common enough to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">its own name</a>. 

I visited Paris for the first time in 2013. I took a disposable camera with me, and it was full of snapshots of the banks of the Seine and flower markets and crepes... but also, a boy whose name I've long forgotten pressed into my cheek, and his tattoo, and a band playing in the Metro, and graffiti.

When I moved here, I moved for a relationship. I thought by being aware of the cliche, I could avoid the inevitable. As the relationship waxed and waned, so too did Paris. When I briefly moved out, the inevitable bureaucracy involved with moving became a monitor strapped around my ankle, an ever-present force dragging me further into the ground. Every negative interaction was heightened into a never-ending loop, forever forming a sandstorm in my brain. I'd spend evenings obsessing over the waitress who mimicked my (granted, truly awful) French accent.

But when things were good - when we picnicked in the parks, drank wine without judgement, sought each other in the dark - every detail, every grandiose door, every gargoyle face stared back at me with the absurd joy of the inanity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne_Haussmann">a city made by one architect</a>.

And when things ended, I went for a walk and sat for a while at a cafe. There I was, in a city like any other, needing to figure out a way to keep moving forward.
