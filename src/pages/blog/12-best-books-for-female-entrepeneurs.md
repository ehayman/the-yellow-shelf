  France is, somewhat surprisingly, the most successful foreign market for
  McDonalds. A rebranding (green logo instead of red) combined with locally
  sourced ingredients (initially for political reasons but with the side effect
  of tastier burgers) has led to "McDo" <a

      Sally Jay's voice is sharp and poignant in the same breath; meanwhile, the
      story is less of an arc and more of a frolic. Young and rootless and in
      Paris for the first time, she flits around the city reveling in everything
      (and everyone) with which she comes in contact. In the words of Groucho
      Marx, "it made me laugh, scream, and guffaw (which, incidentally, is a
      great name for a law firm)."

    description: >-
      Julia Child loved two things in this world deeply: France, and the "many
      pleasures of cooking and eating." Beautifully written, this story
      chronicles Julia's discovery of both these passions, from her first
      lunchtime glass of wine (the horror!) to the eventual publication of her
      now-iconic <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>.


      <blockquote>"The longer I was in France, the stronger and more ecstatic my
      feelings for it became. I missed my family, of course, and things like
      certain cosmetics or really good coffee. But the U.S. seemed like an
      increasingly distant and dreamlike place."</blockquote>

      Very few novels have the power to both make me sob my guts out in a
      mascara-running-this-is-not-remotely-attractive type way *and* stay up far
      too late on a school night turning pages as quickly as I can unstick them
      from my tears. <em>The Great Believers</em> is massive in the scope it
      covers, but still feels deeply familiar; split between the 1980's Chicago
      AIDS epidemic and modern day Paris, it reckons with the lasting impact on
      both a community and its survivors.


      <blockquote>"And was friendship that different in the end from love? You
      took the possibility of sex out of it, and it was all about the moment
      anyway. Being here, right now, in someone’s life. Making room for someone
      in yours."</blockquote>

    bookauthor: George Orwell
    coverimage: /img/9780141184388.jpg
    description: >-
      Orwell's fictional memoir mucks around in the basest of Parisian society
      during the early 20th century. The highlight is perhaps his descriptions
      of the grand hôtel kitchens - the general filth and infestation lying just
      below the glitter and sparkle above - followed by his friendships formed
      with tramps, gutter-dwellers, and general down-and-outs.


      <blockquote>"It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing
      yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going
      to the dogs — and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and
      you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety."</blockquote>

    description: >-
      "Thriller" doesn't quite cover this novel - it's the type of book that
      lodges itself in an uncomfortable part of your brain, in a place where you
      can never quite reach to scratch it away. The story follows the embedding
      of a nanny into the picture-perfect Parisian life of a lawyer's family,
      from the murder of the children to the events preceding. While you never
      do get the perfect answer, the consistent sense of disquiet along the way
      more than makes up for it.

      do without."</blockquote>
