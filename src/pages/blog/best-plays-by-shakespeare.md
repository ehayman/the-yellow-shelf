      Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the
      start--Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for
      Lysander. Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law.
      On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius.
      Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but
      are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an
      enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and
      Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant
      boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs
      loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first
      thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play
      for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania
      for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.

      Putting romance onstage,*The Tempest*gives us a magician, Prospero, a
      former duke of Milan who was displaced by his treacherous brother,
      Antonio. Prospero is exiled on an island, where his only companions are
      his daughter, Miranda, the spirit Ariel, and the monster Caliban. When his
      enemies are among those caught in a storm near the island, Prospero turns
      his power upon them through Ariel and other spirits.\

      \

      The characters exceed the roles of villains and heroes. Prospero seems
      heroic, yet he enslaves Caliban and has an appetite for revenge. Caliban
      seems to be a monster for attacking Miranda, but appears heroic in
      resisting Prospero, evoking the period of colonialism during which the
      play was written. Mirandaâ€™s engagement to Ferdinand, the Prince of Naples
      and a member of the shipwrecked party, helps resolve the drama.
